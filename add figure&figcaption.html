                 <p>MS Dhoni is a right-handed batsman and wicket-keeper. He is famously known for his lower-order attacking mode which he later changed due to his responsibility as a captain. He is also one of the fastest running men between the wickets. His Helicopter Shot technique is loved by all which was taught to him by his fellow player childhood friend Santosh Lal. </p>
